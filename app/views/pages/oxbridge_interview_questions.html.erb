<p><b>Economics</b></br>
There are 8 coins to be divided between A and B. A first makes an offer of how to divide the 
8 coins between them. If B refuses A’s offer, then now it is B’s turn to make the offer, but 
this time 4 coins are taken away so that only 4 coins can be divided between them. Again, if 
A refuses B’s offer then now A can make an offer again, but again the stake is halved to two 
coins. Once a single coin remains, whoever makes the offer takes the coin. What offer should 
A make at the beginning? (assuming B is rational, and A knows that B is rational)</p></br>
